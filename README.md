# Video Player Sample in ReactJS
A video player designed to learn about ReactJS patterns.
## Introduction
This sample app is written in JavaScript using the ReactJS library. Information can be found online on how to set up an environment to get this sample app to run. The primary aim of this project was to learn about stateful parent components and how information can be passed down to child stateless components. The children would render and display the data in appropriate elements. This can be quite useful in a project containing changing states, and organizing the moving pieces to facilitate proper rendering.
## Credits
This project is taken from CodeCademy's Learn ReactJS Part II course. I strongly recommend taking it if you'd like to learn about ReactJS.
